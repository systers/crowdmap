# Contributing Guidelines
* You can join our [slack channel](http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/).  Each active repo has its own channel to direct questions to (for example #powerup or #portal).  
* Remember that this is an inclusive community, committed to creating a safe, positive environment.  See the full [Code of Conduct](http://www.systers.io/code-of-conduct.html).
## General Guidelines
* If you’re just getting started work on an issue labeled “First Timers Only” in any project. additional resources are available on our [website](http://www.systers.io).
* In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from an from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  
* After approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.
* When sending a PR have an appropriate title referencing the issue which it solves. Add “fixes #<issue-number>” in the commit body, so that when the PR gets merged, the issue get closed automatically. Do not do this if the PR solves only a part of the issue. See more information on commit guidelines [here](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).
* If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
